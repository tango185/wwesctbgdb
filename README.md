# wwesctbgdb

This repository is meant only to maintain a public copy of the wwesctbgdb database. This database will be filled
continuously over time using the [wwesctbgfill](https://github.com/tango185/TBGDBFill) project and will be accessed for
use with the [wwesctbgcalc](https://github.com/tango185/TBGCalc).

The included MySQL dump file is ready for use but does not create the database itself. Simply create a database named
"wwesctbgdb" before using the dump file to create and fill the table.
